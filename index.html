            <p>     The French Enlightenment writer known as Voltaire once wrote, "It is better to risk saving a guilty man than to condemn an innocent one."  The United States judicial system once embodied Voltaire's bold words and was committed to the well known phrase: "Innocent until proven guilty."  Nonetheless, the judicial system seems to be straying every moment further and further from that decree.

            <p>     Case and point:  John McDonald was accused of forcing another car, driven by Shanie Hansen, into oncoming traffic which collided with a motorcycle carrying two people, Anthony Soldano and Gina Blackstone.  The Shanie Hansen was severely injured by the accident and Anthony Soldano and Gina Blackstone were killed.  News companies took the story given by Shanie Hansen and reported it that night on [FIND THE NEWS STATION THAT REPORTED THIS AND PUT THEM HERE] laying the full weight of the accident on John's shoulders.  From the very begining, without hearing his side of the story, John was the evil villain who caused severe injuries and two deaths.   The media, police, and city residents were intent on finding him to make him pay for these crimes.  Already accused, judged, and condemned, John's hopes of conveying his innocence to everyone around him were slim to none.  He was no longer seen as 'innocent until proven guilty' but 'guilty until proven innocent.'</p>
            <p>     The intent of this article is not to shift the blame or invoke condemnation upon another person, but to shed light on the actual events that transpired during the moments leading up to the accident and all of those that followed in court.  An attempt will be made to recap these tragic events using recorded testimonies, accident reports, eye-witness accounts, and official court transcripts to clearly and accurately relay the facts and also the follies.</p>
