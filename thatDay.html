                With the smell of rubber in the air, and a piller of dust settling, the lives of two 
                motercyclers were taken. It is an amazing thing, looking back on any tragic event, and
                seeing all the little turns, if any of which were different lives would have been 
                spared, and lives would be different.

                While on vacation in California, doing a little business, and enjoying time with his 
                family, John McDonald took his children, with his wife coming later, to a family reunion
                to see his Father.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Part of the reunion was to take place in a lake, so he hitched up his boat and left with
                his Children. On one of the outings the boat struck shallow water and bent the prop/shaft.
                It needed to be repaired. After the repairs were complete John picked up the boat and was 
                retuning to his sister home to complete the vacation. On this ride home there was a fatal
                accedent. There were several key vehicles and witnesses. This wreck ended in three 
                tradgedies the loss of life to two motorcyclists, and the imprisonment of John McDonald.
